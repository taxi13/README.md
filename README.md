Hi, you can call me Karsh! I <b> head WEB 3 division at Entrepreneur Media (APAC) </b> and have been building successful ventures through content, community, and capital. I've had the privilege of working on leadership teams at prominent media consulting firms such as TED, INK and Entrepreneur.com, and even conceptualized and directed the <b> <i>largest spiritual metaverse festival for ISKCON during the pandemic of 2021 </b> </i>. My entrepreneurial spirit has driven success in the hyper-personalized gifting industry and as a Marcom business partner in my early years.

With a background in workplace leadership development, culture, and branding, I have consulted for top companies including CRED, Intel, and Accenture, and have supported Invest India, ISKCON, the Government of Chhattisgarh, and the FICCI in their initiatives. I also share my knowledge and experience through contributions to Wikipedia and other publications, and provide startup guidance in community building, fundraising, media buying, lean growth, and leadership development.



⚡ Fun fact: ...
Logo of myhh first startup - Poetcard. Hyper-personalized alternative for broing archies/hallmark card built on top a pan-India writers community, I started in 2nd year of college after heart-break. First startups are crazy, right 💔
